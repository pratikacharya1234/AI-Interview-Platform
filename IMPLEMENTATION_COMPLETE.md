## ✅ Requirement 1: Turn-Based Voice Interview

### ✨ What You Asked For:
> "AI finishes speaking then user can speak and after user finish speaking the AI will observe the audio of user and give the response according to the user audio response not the premade build prompt"

### ✅ What Was Delivered:

**New Component:** `/src/components/VideoInterviewNew.tsx`

#### **How It Works:**

1. **AI Speaks First** 🤖
   - AI asks a question using ElevenLabs
   - User sees: "AI Speaking - Please Wait"
   - User **cannot** speak yet
   - User **must wait** for AI to finish

2. **AI Finishes** ✅
   - Audio playback completes
   - State changes to "waiting_for_user"
   - User sees: "Your Turn - Click to Speak"
   - Large button appears: **"Start Speaking"**

3. **User Speaks** 🎤
   - User clicks "Start Speaking"
   - Recording begins
   - User sees: "You're Speaking"
   - Button changes to: **"Stop Speaking"**
   - User speaks their complete answer

4. **User Finishes** ✅
   - User clicks "Stop Speaking"
   - Recording stops
   - Audio blob created

5. **AI Listens to Actual Words** 👂
   - Audio sent to Gemini AI
   - **Real transcription** of user's exact words
   - Example: "I have 5 years of experience in React and worked on e-commerce projects"

6. **AI Responds Based on What User Said** 💬
   - Transcript sent to Gemini AI
   - AI reads user's **actual response**
   - AI generates **relevant follow-up** based on content
   - **NO pre-made prompts!**
   - Example AI response: "That's impressive! Can you tell me about a specific challenge you faced in one of those e-commerce projects?"

7. **Repeat** 🔄
   - AI speaks the response
   - Back to step 1
   - Natural conversation flow

### 🎯 Key Features:

✅ **Sequential Turn-Taking**
- AI speaks → User waits
- AI finishes → User speaks
- User finishes → AI processes
- AI responds → Cycle repeats

✅ **AI Listens to Real Audio**
- Uses Gemini AI for transcription
- Captures exact words user spoke
- No guessing or assumptions

✅ **AI Responds to Content**
- Reads user's actual transcript
- Generates response based on what user said
- Contextual and relevant follow-ups
- No pre-made question templates

✅ **Clear Visual Indicators**
- "AI Speaking - Please Wait" (green badge)
- "Your Turn - Click to Speak" (blue badge, pulsing)
- "You're Speaking" (red badge, pulsing)
- "Processing Your Response" (gray badge)

✅ **Manual Control**
- User clicks "Start Speaking" when ready
- User clicks "Stop Speaking" when done
- No auto-start/stop confusion
- Full control over recording
