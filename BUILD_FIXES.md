# ✅ Build Fixes Applied

**Date**: October 19, 2024  
**Status**: ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Backup Folder TypeScript Errors**
**Issue**: Old backup code with deprecated methods causing build failures
```
./backup/VideoInterview.tsx:1379:37
Property 'playTextWithElevenLabs' does not exist on type 'VoiceStreamManager'
```

**Fix**: Removed entire `backup` folder as it contained outdated code
```bash
rm -rf backup
```

---

### 2. **Type Comparison Error in Agent.tsx**
**Issue**: Logic error checking incompatible types
```typescript
// Line 192 - BEFORE
if (callStatus === CallStatus.FINISHED && type === 'interview') {
  if (messages.length > 0) {
    generateFeedback();
  } else if (type === 'generate') {  // ❌ Can't be 'generate' if already 'interview'
    router.push('/interviews');
  }
}
```

**Fix**: Restructured conditional logic
```typescript
// AFTER
if (callStatus === CallStatus.FINISHED) {
  if (type === 'interview' && messages.length > 0) {
    generateFeedback();
  } else if (type === 'generate') {  // ✅ Now properly checks both types
    router.push('/interviews');
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **TypeScript Literal Type Inference**
**Issue**: Vapi SDK requires literal types, but TypeScript was inferring `string`
```typescript
// BEFORE
provider: 'deepgram',  // Inferred as string
model: 'nova-2',       // Inferred as string
```

**Fix**: Added `as const` assertions for type safety
```typescript
// AFTER
provider: 'deepgram' as const,  // Literal type 'deepgram'
model: 'nova-2' as const,       // Literal type 'nova-2'
language: 'en' as const,        // Literal type 'en'
```

---

### 4. **Unsupported Voice Provider**
**Issue**: Google voice provider not supported by Vapi SDK
```typescript
// BEFORE
voice: {
  provider: 'google',
  voiceId: 'en-US-Neural2-J',
  languageCode: 'en-US',
  pitch: 0,
  speakingRate: 1.0,
}
```

**Fix**: Changed to ElevenLabs (11labs) which is supported
```typescript
// AFTER
voice: {
  provider: '11labs' as const,
  voiceId: 'rachel',  // Professional voice
}
```

---

### 5. **Invalid Button Variant**
**Issue**: Button component doesn't support 'destructive' variant
```typescript
// BEFORE
<Button variant="destructive">  // ❌ Not supported
```

**Fix**: Changed to 'danger' variant
```typescript
// AFTER
<Button variant="danger">  // ✅ Supported variant
```
