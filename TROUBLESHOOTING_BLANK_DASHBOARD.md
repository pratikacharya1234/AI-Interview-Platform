# Troubleshooting: Blank Dashboard After Sign-In

## Problem
After signing in with GitHub, you're redirected to `/dashboard` but see only a blank page instead of your dashboard.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Missing Database Records** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MOST LIKELY**
When you sign in for the first time, Supabase creates a record in `auth.users`, but the application needs additional records in several tables:
- `profiles`
- `user_profiles`
- `user_preferences`
- `user_streaks`
- `user_scores`

**Without these records, the dashboard APIs fail and show a blank page.**

### 2. **Session Not Being Saved**
Cookies from the auth callback might not be persisting correctly.

### 3. **SupabaseProvider Not Loading User**
The client-side Supabase provider might not be reading the session correctly.

## Solution: Step-by-Step Diagnostic Process

### **Step 1: Run the Database Migration** üîß

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!**

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Copy the entire contents of `migrations/fix_auth_and_dashboard.sql`
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
7. Wait for "Success. No rows returned"

This migration:
- ‚úÖ Creates a database trigger that automatically creates user profiles on sign-in
- ‚úÖ Creates all required tables with proper schemas
- ‚úÖ Backfills records for existing users
- ‚úÖ Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ‚úÖ Adds performance indexes

### **Step 2: Clear Browser Data and Test** üîÑ

After running the migration:

1. **Sign Out** (if signed in)
2. **Clear Browser Cookies and Cache:**
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí "Cookies and other site data" ‚Üí Clear data
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí Clear
3. **Close all browser tabs** for your app
4. **Open browser DevTools** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
5. Go to the **Console** tab
6. **Sign in again with GitHub**

### **Step 3: Check Browser Console Logs** üìã

After signing in, you should see logs in the browser console:

**‚úÖ Expected Success Flow:**
```
=== SupabaseProvider: Initializing auth ===
Current pathname: /dashboard
Document cookies: [long string of cookies]
Supabase URL: https://xxxxx.supabase.co...
Calling supabase.auth.getSession()...
‚úì Session loaded: { hasSession: true, userId: "xxx-xxx-xxx", email: "you@email.com", ... }
‚úì User authenticated: you@email.com
=== SupabaseProvider: Auth initialization complete ===
üîÑ Supabase auth state changed: INITIAL_SESSION { hasSession: true, ... }
```

**‚ùå Problem Indicators:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No session found
// OR
‚ùå Error getting session: [some error]
// OR
ModernLayout: No user detected, showing redirect message
```

### **Step 4: Check Network Tab** üåê

1. In DevTools, go to **Network** tab
2. Look for the request to `/api/dashboard/stats`
3. Click on it and check the **Response**:

**‚úÖ Good Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stats": {
    "totalInterviews": 0,
    "averageScore": 0,
    ...
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "your-user-id",
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }
}
```

**‚ùå Bad Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Please sign in to view your statistics"
}
// OR 500 error
```

### **Step 5: Verify Database Records** üóÑÔ∏è

In Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Table Editor** (left sidebar)
2. Check the following tables have a record with your user_id:
   - ‚úÖ `auth.users` (should have your record)
   - ‚úÖ `profiles` (check if your record exists)
   - ‚úÖ `user_profiles` (check if your record exists)
   - ‚úÖ `user_preferences` (check if your record exists)
   - ‚úÖ `user_streaks` (check if your record exists)

**If any table is missing your record**, the migration didn't run correctly. Run it again.

### **Step 6: Check Server Logs** üìù

If you're running locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then sign in and look for these logs in your terminal:

**‚úÖ Good Flow:**
```
=== Auth Callback Start ===
Full URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback?code=xxx&redirect=/dashboard
Code present: true
‚úì Session created successfully
User ID: your-user-id
User email: your@email.com
Response cookies being set: ['sb-access-token', 'sb-refresh-token', ...]
=== Auth Callback End ===
Redirecting to: /dashboard
```

**‚ùå Problem Indicators:**
```
‚ùå Error getting session: ...
// OR
No code provided in callback
// OR
No session returned after code exchange
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: "Verifying authentication..." message stays forever

**Cause:** Cookies are not being set or read correctly.

**Fix:**
1. Check if cookies are blocked in your browser (especially in incognito/private mode)
2. Verify your Supabase URL and Anon Key are correct in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```
3. Make sure you're using the same domain (don't mix localhost and 127.0.0.1)
4. Clear all cookies and try again

### Issue 2: Dashboard APIs return 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Session cookies are not being sent with API requests.

**Fix:**
1. Check if middleware is correctly handling authentication
2. Verify RLS policies are set up correctly (run the migration)
3. Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue 3: "No rows returned" or empty dashboard stats

**Cause:** User records exist but no interview data yet.

**This is normal for new users!** The dashboard should still load and show zeros.

**If it's blank instead of showing zeros:**
1. Check modern-dashboard.tsx is handling loading/error states
2. Check console for JavaScript errors
3. Run the migration to ensure database schema is correct

### Issue 4: Infinite redirect loop

**Cause:** Middleware thinks user is not authenticated even though they are.

**Fix:**
1. Check middleware.ts is not blocking dashboard route
2. Verify cookies are being set with correct domain and path
3. Clear all cookies and cache, then try again

### Issue 5: "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warning

**Cause:** Multiple Supabase clients being created.

**Fix:**
The singleton pattern in `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` should prevent this. If you still see it:
1. Check you're not creating clients manually anywhere
2. Use `useSupabase()` hook instead of creating new clients
3. Restart the dev server

## Environment Variables Checklist ‚úÖ

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJxxx...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJxxx...

# Gemini (optional for now)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key

# Remove these if present (they're from NextAuth)
# NEXTAUTH_URL - DELETE
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET - DELETE
```

---

## Advanced Debugging

### Enable Detailed Logging

The code now has comprehensive logging. Check:

1. **Browser Console** - Client-side auth flow
2. **Terminal/Server Logs** - Server-side auth flow
3. **Network Tab** - API responses
4. **Supabase Logs** - Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs

### Test Authentication API Endpoint

Create a test file to verify auth is working:

```bash
# After signing in, test if you can access protected API
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Cookie: $(curl -c - http://localhost:3000 | grep supabase)"
```

### Check Middleware Is Running

Add this to `middleware.ts` line 4:
```typescript
console.log('Middleware running for:', request.nextUrl.pathname)
```

Restart dev server and watch logs when you navigate to `/dashboard`.

## Still Not Working?

If you've tried all the above and still see a blank dashboard:

1. **Share these details:**
   - Browser console logs (full output)
   - Server terminal logs (full output)
   - Network tab screenshot showing `/api/dashboard/stats` response
   - Screenshot of Supabase Table Editor showing `profiles` and `user_profiles` tables

2. **Temporary workaround:**
   - Manually create records in database:
   ```sql
   -- Replace 'your-user-id-here' with your actual user ID from auth.users
   INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, username, full_name)
   VALUES (
     'your-user-id-here',
     'your@email.com',
     'username',
     'Your Name'
   );

   INSERT INTO user_profiles (user_id, display_name)
   VALUES ('your-user-id-here', 'Your Name');

   INSERT INTO user_preferences (user_id)
   VALUES ('your-user-id-here');

   INSERT INTO user_streaks (user_id, streak_type)
   VALUES ('your-user-id-here', 'daily_practice');
   ```

3. **Nuclear option (start fresh):**
   ```bash
   # Clear all local data
   rm -rf .next node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

## What Changed

I've added extensive logging to help diagnose the issue:

### Files Updated:
1. **`src/components/providers/supabase-provider.tsx`**
   - Added detailed console logs for auth initialization
   - Added emoji indicators for different auth events
   - Logs show exactly what's happening with your session

2. **`src/components/layout/modern-layout.tsx`**
   - Changed `return null` to show a message instead of blank page
   - Now you'll see "Verifying authentication..." instead of nothing

3. **`src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`**
   - Added logging to show cookies being set
   - Logs show if session was created successfully
   - Shows redirect target

4. **`migrations/fix_auth_and_dashboard.sql`**
   - **RUN THIS FIRST!** - Creates database trigger for auto profile creation

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the migration SQL in Supabase Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Clear browser cookies and cache
3. ‚úÖ Sign in again with DevTools console open
4. ‚úÖ Check console logs and share them if still not working

The logs will tell us exactly where the authentication flow is breaking!
