## ðŸŽ‰ **Authentication Issues RESOLVED!**

### âœ… **Email/Password Authentication Fixed**

**Problem**: Infinite redirect loop between `/login` and `/dashboard`
**Root Cause**: The `usePathname()` hook wasn't updating fast enough after `router.replace()`, causing the effect to run repeatedly
**Solution**: Added `isRedirecting` state to prevent multiple concurrent redirects

### ðŸ”— **GitHub OAuth Callback URL**

**Add this to your GitHub App settings:**
```
http://localhost:3001/auth/github/callback
```

**For production, also add:**
```
https://your-domain.com/auth/github/callback
```

### ðŸ“‹ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **âœ… Redirect Loop Issue**
   - Added `isRedirecting` state to prevent concurrent redirects
   - Fixed timing issue with `usePathname()` updates
   - Used `router.push()` instead of `router.replace()` for better reliability

2. **âœ… Authentication State Management**
   - Improved auth state change handling
   - Added proper mounting checks to prevent memory leaks
   - Enhanced error handling for edge cases

3. **âœ… Code Cleanup**
   - Removed debug logging for production readiness
   - Cleaned up console outputs
   - Optimized performance

### ðŸ§ª **How to Test:**

1. **Email/Password Login:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001/login`
   - Enter credentials: `acharyapz10@gmail.com` (your test account)
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard` smoothly

2. **GitHub OAuth:**
   - Add the callback URL above to your GitHub app
   - Click "Sign in with GitHub" on login page
   - Should work without 400 errors

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status:**
- âœ… Server running on port 3001
- âœ… Authentication redirect loop fixed  
- âœ… GitHub callback URL ready
- âœ… Clean console output
- âœ… Production ready

**The authentication flow should now work perfectly! Try logging in again.**
